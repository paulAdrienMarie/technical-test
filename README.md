## Feature

- error message during signup when password is too short   


## Do you have any feedback about the code/architecture of the project and what was the difficulty you encountered while doing it? 

The code architecture is pretty comprehensive after taking the time to understand clearly how everything works.

All the variables are not very meaningful at first sight, making it a little harder to understand.

It was my first time in React so I tried to assimilate as many things as I could in this short amount of time.
